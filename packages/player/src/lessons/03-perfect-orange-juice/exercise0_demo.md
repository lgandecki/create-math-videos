# Lesson 3 — Ratio ≠ Difference • “Perfect Orange Juice”

## Exercise Flow

Retail juice is too sweet, so you dilute it.
The recipe says 1 part concentrate on 3 parts water.

```ts
setMixture({ concentrate: 200, units: "ml", proportion: "1:3" });
```

If you mix 200 mL concentrate, how much water (in mL) will you need?

### Check

```ts
waitForCompletedMixture(600);
```

#### Incorrect Answer

Not quite yet.

#### Correct Answer

Good job! You’ve correctly diluted it!
