# Lesson 1: Guided Practice

## Exercise Flow

Now it's your turn. You won't believe it, but your goal is to make the dino so big that it explodes!

Just move the inner circle so that its "1" aligns with the number that makes the dino go: BOOOOOM!

### Check

```js
waitForAlignmentTo(14);
```

That's probably why dinosaurs aren't with us anymore... or so they say! 🦖💥
