# Lesson 0: Demo - How Dinosaurs Scale 🦖

## Exercise Flow

Hi! I'm your assistant. I'm here to help you understand something amazing about dinosaurs.

Today, we're exploring what happens when a dinosaur grows bigger.

Let me explain. I'll walk you through the scaling process.

Now, I'll set the '1' on the inner circle to align with '2' on the outer circle.
Watch what happens when our dinosaur grows to double its height (2×).

```js
alignInnerDiskTo(2);
```

Amazing! The height doubled, but look at the area and mass. The area became 4 times bigger, and the mass became 8 times heavier!

Let's try something even more dramatic - triple the height (3×).

```js
askForEstimation({ prompt: "Do you know what the answer will be?" });
```

```js
askForEstimation({ prompt: "Height ×3 – mass changes by…?", expect: 27, tolerance: 0.2, units: "×", timeLimit: 6 });
alignInnerDiskTo(3);
```

Incredible! At 3× the height, our dinosaur now has 27× the mass. That's the Dino Law of Squares and Cubes in action!

This is why giant dinosaurs had such massive, thick legs - they needed to support all that extra weight!
