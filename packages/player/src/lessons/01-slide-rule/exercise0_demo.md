# Lesson 0: Demo - How It Works

## Exercise Flow

Hi! I'm your assistant. I'm here to help.

Today, we're multiplying 2 by 3.

Let me explain. I'll walk you through the process.

First, I'll set the '1' on the inner circle to align with '2' on the outer circle.

```js
alignInnerDiskTo(2);
```

Great. Now, I'll look for '3' on the inner circle and read the result on the outer circle.

```js
showResultAt(3);
```

The result is 6! Look how easy and fast it was.

```js
resetSlideRule();
```
