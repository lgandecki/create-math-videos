# Lesson Lesson 10 — Logs as “How Many Doublings?” • “Richter Reality”

## Real-World Hook

Richter 6 vs 7: how much stronger?

Each step in Richter scale means that the amplitude of vibrations grows 10 times.
Thus, each step in Richter scale means that the perceived energy of the shock grows by square root of 1000 which equals to 31,6227766 times.

```js
askForEstimation({ prompt: "How much is the fish?!", expect: 31.6, tolerance: 0.2, units: "times" });
```
